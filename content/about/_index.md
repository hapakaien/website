My name is Ahmad Husen, but most people call me Husen. I am a self-taught web
developer from Klaten, Indonesia.  

From a young age, I have always been interested in technology. My introduction
to web development was when I was in junior high school wanting to change the
theme of my mobile blog which could only be done via CSS. I did it using
[my first phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_7610). It turned out to be
fun for me to do this. From that moment on, I could immediately imagine what I
would be like in 5 years.

My main focus in web development is **simplicity**, **stability** and
**performance**. The code I wrote is easy to maintain and scale. I did that
because I wanted to create the **best web experience** possible.

## Experience

Since I finished my education in vocational high school in 2016, I have worked
on several projects. For over 3 years, I have been using web technologies to
help companies increase productivity which leads to increased profits. Along
with that, I have also worked on several freelance and side projects to date.

- **Web Developer** at Mabito Karya - Bandung, Indonesia  
  2016 - 2019  
  - Maintainance a company's Virtual Private Server (VPS)
  - Manage Learning Management System for company's clients
  - Create internal web-based information system for company
  - Ensure data transfer between divisions is seamless

- **Freelance Web Developer** - Remote  
  2018 - present  
  - Create web based projects to meet client satisfaction
  - Make sure the project is easy to maintain
  - Maintenance project for a limited time (for agreed)

Apart from that, I also create and contribute to several
[open source projects]({{< relref "project" >}}). I do it to learn new things,
add to my new skills, and contribute to the community.

## Skill

I believe there is no such thing as the best programming language or framework
in software development. The truth is there is always the right tools for the
job. And as a curious person, I am always up to date and open to new
technologies.

But, most of the time, I'm comfortable working with TypeScript (or JavaScript),
SQL, HTML, and CSS, sometimes PHP too. I'm currently focusing on
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/),
[Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/), [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/),
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Redis](https://redis.io/),
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/),
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and more...

## I have a few hobbies

When I'm not coding, I'll stay as far away from my laptop as possible. One thing
that has always been able to help me to do that is my motorcycle. I usually ride
it around town or even take long trips if I have enough time. I also like
motorsport in general. But I've always loved MotoGP and been a fan of it since I
was in 5th grade.

## My other hobbies?

I don't have many other hobbies, but when I have free time, I usually write an
article on [my blog]({{< relref "article" >}}) about
something I've just learned, and sometimes watch movies too.
