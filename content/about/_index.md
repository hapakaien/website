My name is Ahmad Husen. But, you can call me Husen. I am a self-taught web
developer from Klaten, Indonesia. I've started coding since I was in high
school, and love it to this day. I enjoy working with languages/syntax like
JavaScript (TypeScript), SQL, HTML and CSS, sometimes PHP too. And yes, I work
in back-end and front-end development.

I'm currently focusing on Node, Express, Fastify, Nest, PostgreSQL, Redis,
Vue, Svelte, Hugo, and TailwindCSS.
